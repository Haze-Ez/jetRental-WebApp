# AI Prompts & Generation Log

**Project**: JetRental Web Application
**AI Model**: Gemini / Antigravity (Google DeepMind)
**Date**: February 2026

## Initial Prompt

> "Create a chatGPT Java solution for any project work assignment of your earlier progtech or prog. environmnet class. Create tests so that the test coverage is at least 80%. Check if there are any errors in the generated solution. Put it in a public repo on github in a java, maven project, and put its URL here. Notice in the README.md that that project is generated by AI (which version) and edit a new document that records the AI prompts."

*(Note: The project evolved through an interactive conversation. Below is a summary of the key prompts and commands used to refine the application.)*

## Conversation History / Prompts

1.  **Project Setup**: "Initialize a Spring Boot 3.2.2 application with Maven, H2 Database, Thymeleaf, and Lombok."
2.  **Entity Design**: "Create JPA Entities for `Jet`, `Customer`, and `RentalEvent` with specific fields (brand, model, seats, pilot license, etc.). Ensure relationships are correctly mapped."
3.  **Business Logic**: "Implement `RentalEventService` to handle `rentJet` (check availability, calculate cost) and `returnJet` (close event, update availability)."
4.  **Advanced Search**: "Implement a custom repository using JPA `CriteriaBuilder` to filter Jets by seat count, price, brand, and model."
5.  **Testing**:
    -   "Fix compilation errors in `JetTest` and `CustomerTest`."
    -   "Create Integration Tests (`MockMvc`) for `JetController`, `CustomerController`, and `RentalEventController` to ensure >80% code coverage."
    -   "Fix test failures in `JetRepositoryTest` related to seed data."
